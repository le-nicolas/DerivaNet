it seems to me that nature has its own way of doing this. and the nice thing about us is we can quantify and measure stuff.
here we have a neural net. to utilize a neural network for streamlined analysis by providing specific contexts and data inputs. 

Synthetic datasets are created by charting toy complexity against size, then adding noise for realism.


Conversion into numpy arrays enhances efficiency, particularly with binary variables represented as -1 and 1. Employ Support Vector Machine (SVM) model training with labeled data, necessitating 2D numpy arrays for coordinates and labels. Consistent normalization and color label mapping to numerical values ensure accuracy. This approach enables the neural network to discern preferences based on toy size and complexity effectively.




TL;dr- THIS is a toy chart of size and complexity.
